Trying to solve the basic data structure problems including problems related to Array, Linked List, Stack etc... https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/

P.S:- If you see a file name followed by a number, the code in that Java file is more efficient/optimized than the previous one. 
For instance, Arr_rotation1.java is a better/optimized code than Arr_rotation.java
